            <a class = "title">About CVRE</a>
            <a class = "information"><br />CVRE is an inter-collegiate virtual reality eSports league working to create an environment for enthusiasts to gather and enjoy fun, competitive play, as well as to build a community of teams representing universities across the United States. We are starting our first season in October 2018, and are actively looking for sponsors and additional teams to participate in future tournaments.</a>
            <a class = "information"><br />Universities currently fielding teams include: Baylor, Texas A&M, UC Berkeley, Florida International, Miami, DePaul and Drexel. </a>
            <a class = "information"><br />We are currently competing in Echo Arena, Beat Saber, and Rec Royale, with plans to include more games in the spring. Regular-season matches will be played starting in early October, with an onsite tournament at the end of November. Every match will be live-streamed on both participating VR clubs' Twitch accounts as well as the official CVR Twitch account.</a>
            <a class = "information"><br />CVRE was founded on March 20th, 2018. We are currently in the process of building up the league's infrastructure, and are excited to see VR eSports continue to grow!</a>
